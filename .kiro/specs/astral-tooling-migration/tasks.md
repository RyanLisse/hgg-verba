# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update pyproject.toml configuration for uv and ruff
  - Migrate all dependencies from setup.py to pyproject.toml dependency groups
  - Add comprehensive ruff configuration for linting and formatting
  - Configure uv-specific settings and dependency groups
  - Remove black configuration and add ty configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Remove legacy configuration files
  - Delete setup.py file since pyproject.toml now contains all metadata
  - Remove requirements-supabase.txt and migrate dependencies to pyproject.toml groups
  - Clean up any black-specific configuration remnants
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Update Makefile to use Astral tools
  - Replace pip commands with uv equivalents in all make targets
  - Update linting targets to use ruff for both linting and formatting
  - Add type checking targets using ty
  - Update setup and development workflow commands
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Update Docker configuration for uv optimization
  - Follow uv Docker integration best practices from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/
  - Implement multi-stage Docker builds with uv caching optimization
  - Update docker-compose.yml if needed for new build process
  - Ensure production builds benefit from uv's speed improvements and proper layer caching
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 5. Update development scripts and documentation
  - Modify start-local.sh and other shell scripts to use uv
  - Update SETUP.sh script for new tooling requirements
  - Update README.md with new development setup instructions
  - Update CONTRIBUTING.md with new development workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [-] 6. Configure ruff to replace black functionality
  - Test ruff formatting against current black formatting
  - Ensure ruff configuration produces consistent code style
  - Update any pre-commit hooks or CI configurations
  - Verify ruff handles all current linting requirements
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Add ty type checking configuration and integration
  - Configure ty in pyproject.toml with appropriate strictness settings
  - Add type checking to development workflow and Makefile
  - Create baseline type checking configuration for existing codebase
  - Test ty performance and integration with development tools
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Update CI/CD pipeline configurations
  - Update GitHub Actions workflows to use uv for dependency management
  - Configure ruff for both linting and formatting in CI
  - Add ty type checking to CI pipeline
  - Ensure all CI jobs use the new tooling consistently
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.4, 3.4, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Create migration documentation and backward compatibility
  - Write migration guide for developers transitioning to new tools
  - Document rollback procedures in case of issues
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common migration issues
  - Provide clear upgrade instructions for team members
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 10. Test and validate the complete migration
  - Verify all dependencies install correctly with uv sync
  - Test that ruff formatting and linting work as expected
  - Validate ty type checking runs without errors
  - Ensure Docker builds and runs correctly with new configuration
  - Test that all Makefile targets work with new tooling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 6.1, 6.2_
