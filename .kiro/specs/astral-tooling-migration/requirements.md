# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Verba project from traditional Python tooling (pip, setuptools, mypy) to Astral's modern Python toolchain: uv (package manager), ruff (linter/formatter), and ty (type checker). This migration will improve development speed, reduce dependency conflicts, and provide better tooling consistency across the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use uv as the primary package manager, so that I can benefit from faster dependency resolution and installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs package installation commands THEN the system SHALL use uv instead of pip
2. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN uv SHALL handle all package management operations
3. WHEN virtual environments are created THEN uv SHALL manage the virtual environment lifecycle
4. WHEN the project is set up THEN uv SHALL replace all pip-based workflows in documentation and scripts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ruff to handle all linting and formatting, so that I have consistent code quality with faster execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is linted THEN ruff SHALL replace any existing linting tools (flake8, black, isort)
2. WHEN code is formatted THEN ruff SHALL provide consistent formatting across the entire codebase
3. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN ruff SHALL be integrated into the workflow
4. WHEN CI/CD pipelines execute THEN ruff SHALL be used for code quality checks
5. WHEN configuration is needed THEN ruff settings SHALL be defined in pyproject.toml

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ty to provide fast type checking, so that I can catch type errors quickly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN type checking is performed THEN ty SHALL replace mypy as the primary type checker
2. WHEN type errors exist THEN ty SHALL provide clear and actionable error messages
3. WHEN IDE integration is used THEN ty SHALL work seamlessly with development environments
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN ty SHALL validate type correctness in the pipeline

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated build and configuration files, so that the project uses modern Python packaging standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN pyproject.toml SHALL be the primary configuration file
2. WHEN dependencies are declared THEN they SHALL be specified in pyproject.toml format
3. WHEN development dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be organized in appropriate dependency groups
4. WHEN legacy files exist THEN setup.py and requirements.txt files SHALL be migrated or removed appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and scripts, so that all team members can use the new tooling effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers read documentation THEN all references to pip SHALL be updated to uv
2. WHEN developers run make commands THEN Makefile SHALL use the new Astral tools
3. WHEN developers set up the project THEN setup scripts SHALL use uv for environment management
4. WHEN developers contribute THEN CONTRIBUTING.md SHALL reflect the new development workflow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker and deployment configurations updated, so that production environments use the new tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker images are built THEN Dockerfile SHALL use uv for package installation
2. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL benefit from faster dependency installation
3. WHEN deployment scripts run THEN they SHALL use the updated tooling
4. WHEN CI/CD pipelines execute THEN they SHALL use uv, ruff, and ty consistently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility maintained, so that existing workflows continue to function during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy commands are used THEN they SHALL either work or provide clear migration guidance
2. WHEN existing virtual environments exist THEN migration paths SHALL be documented
3. WHEN team members haven't updated THEN clear upgrade instructions SHALL be provided
4. WHEN issues arise THEN rollback procedures SHALL be documented
