# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete migration from Weaviate vector database to PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for the Verba RAG application. The migration involves removing all Weaviate dependencies, cleaning up related code and configuration files, updating environment settings, and ensuring the Railway deployment works seamlessly with PostgreSQL as the sole vector database backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all Weaviate dependencies from the codebase, so that the application no longer relies on Weaviate for vector operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL have no remaining Weaviate import statements
2. WHEN checking Python requirements files THEN the system SHALL not contain any Weaviate-related packages
3. WHEN reviewing package.json files THEN the system SHALL not contain any Weaviate client dependencies
4. WHEN examining class definitions THEN the system SHALL not contain any Weaviate-specific manager or component classes
5. WHEN searching for Weaviate references THEN the system SHALL not contain any hardcoded Weaviate URLs or connection strings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up all Weaviate-specific files and configurations, so that the codebase is free of unused Weaviate artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the goldenverba/components directory THEN the system SHALL not contain any Weaviate-specific manager files
2. WHEN checking configuration files THEN the system SHALL not contain Weaviate service definitions in docker-compose.yml
3. WHEN examining environment files THEN the system SHALL not contain WEAVIATE_URL_VERBA or related environment variables
4. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL not contain Weaviate setup instructions or references
5. WHEN checking script files THEN the system SHALL not contain Weaviate initialization or management scripts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all environment configurations to use PostgreSQL exclusively, so that the application connects only to PostgreSQL for vector operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking .env files THEN the system SHALL contain only PostgreSQL connection variables
2. WHEN reviewing Railway configuration THEN the system SHALL be configured to use PostgreSQL service with pgvector
3. WHEN examining application startup THEN the system SHALL initialize only PostgreSQL connections
4. WHEN checking database managers THEN the system SHALL use only Supabase/PostgreSQL managers
5. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL route all vector operations through PostgreSQL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the Railway deployment works correctly, so that the production environment functions without Weaviate dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Railway THEN the application SHALL start successfully without Weaviate connection errors
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN all document ingestion endpoints SHALL work with PostgreSQL backend
3. WHEN performing vector searches THEN the system SHALL return accurate results using pgvector
4. WHEN checking application logs THEN there SHALL be no Weaviate-related error messages
5. WHEN testing chat functionality THEN the RAG pipeline SHALL work end-to-end with PostgreSQL

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform final cleanup and verification, so that the migration is complete and the system is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Railway dashboard THEN the Weaviate service SHALL be removed if migration is successful
2. WHEN checking documentation THEN all references SHALL point to PostgreSQL-only setup
3. WHEN running import checks THEN there SHALL be no broken imports or missing dependencies
4. WHEN performing integration tests THEN all core functionality SHALL work without Weaviate
5. WHEN reviewing code quality THEN there SHALL be no dead code or unused Weaviate-related functions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain all existing functionality, so that the migration is transparent and doesn't affect my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL process and embed documents using PostgreSQL
2. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL return relevant results with the same quality as before
3. WHEN using chat functionality THEN the RAG responses SHALL maintain the same accuracy and relevance
4. WHEN accessing the frontend THEN all UI components SHALL function normally
5. WHEN checking performance THEN vector operations SHALL perform comparably to the previous Weaviate implementation
