# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes Verba's AI capabilities by integrating the latest language models from major providers (Google Gemini 2.5, OpenAI GPT-4.1 and o1-mini, Claude 4) with advanced reasoning and thinking capabilities. The update includes implementing LiteLLM as a unified proxy for all model providers, upgrading to the latest Pydantic models and Instructor for structured outputs, integrating comprehensive observability and monitoring with PostgreSQL and pgvector, and enhancing the UI with modern AI conversation and reasoning components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Verba, I want access to the latest AI models from all major providers, so that I can leverage the most advanced language capabilities for my RAG applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures model settings THEN the system SHALL support Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro models
2. WHEN a user selects OpenAI models THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4.1 and o1-mini models
3. WHEN a user chooses Claude models THEN the system SHALL support Claude 4 (Sonnet and Haiku variants)
4. WHEN a user queries with reasoning-capable models THEN the system SHALL expose thinking/reasoning capabilities
5. WHEN a user switches between providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent API interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a unified model proxy system, so that I can manage all AI providers through a single interface with consistent error handling and rate limiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use LiteLLM as the primary proxy for all model providers
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN LiteLLM SHALL handle provider-specific authentication and formatting
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN providers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options to alternative models
5. WHEN costs are tracked THEN LiteLLM SHALL provide unified usage and cost monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Verba, I want modern structured output capabilities, so that I can reliably extract and validate data from AI responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structured outputs are requested THEN the system SHALL use the latest Instructor library with Pydantic v2 models
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with retry mechanisms
3. WHEN complex schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL support nested models and advanced validation rules
4. WHEN streaming responses are used THEN the system SHALL support partial structured output parsing
5. WHEN multiple output formats are needed THEN the system SHALL support dynamic schema selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user of the Verba interface, I want to see AI reasoning processes, so that I can understand how the system arrives at its conclusions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using reasoning-capable models THEN the UI SHALL display thinking processes using Kibo UI reasoning components
2. WHEN AI generates responses THEN the interface SHALL show step-by-step reasoning with expandable sections
3. WHEN conversations occur THEN the UI SHALL use modern conversation components with proper message threading
4. WHEN reasoning is complex THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for different reasoning stages
5. WHEN users interact with reasoning THEN they SHALL be able to expand/collapse thinking sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing conversations, I want an enhanced chat interface, so that I can have more natural and organized interactions with the AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users start conversations THEN the interface SHALL use Kibo UI conversation components
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL support rich formatting including code blocks and markdown
3. WHEN conversations are long THEN the interface SHALL provide efficient scrolling and message management
4. WHEN users want to reference previous messages THEN the system SHALL support message threading and references
5. WHEN multiple conversation types occur THEN the interface SHALL distinguish between regular chat and reasoning modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want backward compatibility with existing configurations, so that current Verba installations can upgrade seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading from older versions THEN the system SHALL migrate existing model configurations automatically
2. WHEN legacy API calls are made THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing endpoints
3. WHEN configuration files exist THEN the system SHALL preserve user settings while adding new capabilities
4. WHEN database schemas change THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts for smooth transitions
5. WHEN custom components exist THEN the system SHALL maintain plugin compatibility where possible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with embeddings and retrieval, I want the new models to integrate seamlessly with existing RAG pipelines, so that I can benefit from improved capabilities without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new models are used for generation THEN they SHALL integrate with existing embedding and retrieval components
2. WHEN structured outputs are generated THEN they SHALL be compatible with existing document processing pipelines
3. WHEN reasoning capabilities are used THEN they SHALL enhance but not replace existing RAG functionality
4. WHEN model responses are processed THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing chunking and indexing systems
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN new models SHALL not significantly degrade existing response times

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user configuring model settings, I want granular control over reasoning and thinking capabilities, so that I can optimize the system for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring reasoning models THEN users SHALL be able to enable/disable thinking output display
2. WHEN setting model parameters THEN users SHALL have access to reasoning-specific configuration options
3. WHEN managing costs THEN users SHALL be able to set limits on reasoning token usage
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN users SHALL be able to choose between speed and reasoning depth
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN users SHALL have access to detailed reasoning logs and traces

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability and monitoring of AI model usage, so that I can track performance, costs, and user behavior across all model providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI models are called THEN the system SHALL automatically log all requests and responses to PostgreSQL
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL capture model details, response times, costs, and reasoning metadata
3. WHEN users interact with the system THEN their activities SHALL be tracked with proper user identification
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log failure details with context for debugging
5. WHEN analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards and reporting capabilities
