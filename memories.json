Migration Complexity:\n- Supabase: Medium complexity, requires refactoring WeaviateManager to PostgreSQL\n- Turso: Medium-high complexity, different vector syntax and operations\n- InstantDB: NOT SUITABLE - lacks vector database functionality entirely\n\n4.

Key findings:\n\nMAJOR BREAKING CHANGES:\n- CSS import changes: @tailwind directives → @import \"tailwindcss\"\n- Dark mode: new CSS variable approach with @variant dark (&:where([data-theme=\"dark\"] *))\n- PostCSS plugin: moved to @tailwindcss/postcss package\n- CLI: moved to @tailwindcss/cli package  \n- Vite integration: new @tailwindcss/vite plugin recommended\n- Utility changes: shadow-sm→shadow-xs, outline-none→outline-hidden, ring default 1px vs 3px\n- Border colors: default changed from gray-200 to currentColor\n- Button cursor: changed from pointer to default\n- Space utilities: selector change affects performance\n- Hover: only applies when primary input supports hover\n\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES:\n- Browser requirements: Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+\n- Radix UI: potential animation library conflicts with tailwindcss-animate\n- Dark mode implementation completely changed\n- Variable mapping issues common\n\nMIGRATION STRATEGY:\n1. Use official upgrade tool: npx @tailwindcss/upgrade  \n2. Test in separate branch thoroughly\n3. Update PostCSS/Vite config\n4. Migrate dark mode implementation\n5. Update utility class names\n6. Consider browser support requirements\n\nPERFORMANCE BENEFITS:\n- 3.5x faster full rebuilds\n- 8x faster incremental builds\n- Native CSS variable architecture",
